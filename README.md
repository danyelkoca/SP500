# Stock Market Prediction with Machine Learning
This was my final project for the Matlab class of spring semester, 2018. It is an implementation of machine learning on stock market data.

For this project, no libraries were used. The deep learning algorithm was written manually based on mathematical principles


2 csv files are the daily data for S&P 500 and VIX index, both retrieved from Yahoo Finance. S&P goes back to 1950s while VIX goes back to 1990s. I used a modified version of realized standard deviation to extrapolate VIX into 1950s.

PDF file includes background, method, and how to run the programs found in this repository. Sort of a walk-through. It is intended for people who don't have thorough understanding of stock market analysis.

Others are matlab files which test the code with some toy datas, retrieve and plot the financial data. project_stock.m is where all the action happens.

Some nice figures from this project:

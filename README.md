# matlab-project
This was my final project for the Matlab class of spring semester, 2018. It is an implementation of machine learning on stock market data.
2 csv files are the daily data for S%P 500 and VIX index, both retrieved from Yahoo Finance. S%P goes back to 1950s while VIX goes back to 1990s. I used a modified version of realized standard deviation to extraplate VIX into 1950s.

PDF file includes background, method, and how to run the programs found in this repository. I submitted this file as a walk-through file with my project. It is intended for people who don't have thorough understanding of stock market analysis.

Others are matlab file which retrieve, plot and test the code with some toy datas. project_stock.m is where all the action happens.
